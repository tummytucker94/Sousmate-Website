        <p>Founder Melody Russell, also known as <em>Mamma Mel</em> to the people of her community, was  the neighborhood mother of her community.
           She cooked for the both the kids and the adults&mdash;they all are her family. One day she was cooking Barbecue chicken,
           collard greens, macaroni & cheese, and black-eyed peas when a person had came to her and pitched the idea of her opening up
           a business selling the food that she loved to cook. Plenty of time this ideas however maybe the stars aligned or the gods
           had ordained it but Mel decided to go out on a limb and open the business. 4 years later and with a guidance from her
           friends and family, Sousmate is thriving company that  is on the cusp of expansion.
